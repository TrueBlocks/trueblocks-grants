## Open Issues:

- Should you add Dawid and Michael (?) to the team??

## About

TrueBlocks is a user-centric data index, query and management tool for the Ethereum blockchain. Users can access, view and manage their chain data across multiple accounts and dApps using either their own node or a third-party node-provider’s like Infura.

TrueBlocks offers a unique approach. It treats blockchain data like a “public good”, and unlike many index and data providers it retains the fundamental benefits of a blockchain:
- It limits dependency on a central gatekeeper as it is local-first software. No centralized front-end web 2.0 website,
- It retains the integrity of the chain data.  No need for arbitrators or trust.
- It provides complete privacy.  No web 2.0 website to undermine this.
It promotes cheap, equitable and easy access to all the data.  No spinners, no rate limiting, no truncated data (eg event-only data), no rivalrous fee system.

With TrueBlocks users among other things will be able to:
- View a complete history of their address (es)/account (s) from any device (via TrueBlocks’ API)
- Export fully reconciled transaction history by account/token over any period to QuickBooks, Excel, RStudio, CSV
- Monitor purchased and airdropped tokens (where are my tokens? how many approvals?)
- Manage and secure their NFT collection (using IPFS and avoiding less secure IPFS gateways)
- Receive off-chain email notifications/triggers of activity on their addresses
- Duplicate the indexing provided by theGraph for free (future work)
- Watch activity of DAOs they belong to (what votes are active?)
- Build testing algorithms (eg digital twins) to facilitate smart contract audits and ongoing monitoring

TrueBlocks currently focuses on the Ethereum mainnet, but with some modification can work on L2 side chains and other L1 blockchains. In addition, while this requires further investigation, TrueBlocks may serve as the engine to port centralized web 2.0 front-ends to fully-decentralized models.

## Results from Previous Rounds

Thank you to our supporters from previous GitCoin Grant rounds. We appreciate the support you’ve provided to keep this mostly self-funded project going.

Here’s a video which describes some of what we’ve accomplished since the last round of grants. We are pleased to note that we won a prize from HackFS for our work on publishing Ethereum index data to IPFS. This work will go a long way towards the decentralization and democratization of the data.

Here’s an updated schematic of [How TrueBlocks Works](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hVFSmoy6kMRPSkwg6zZG47fxgUKVxwbc/view).

Check out this video which is a reminder of TrueBlocks’ "user-centric browsing"—a way of viewing Ethereum data that brings the data to you rather than you having to go to the data.

Since the last GitCoin Grant round we’ve accomplished a lot. We’ve:

TBC



All completely local to your own machine, perfectly private, uncensorable and immutable.

How Future Contributions Will Help

We’ve accomplished a lot with your support, but there’s more work to do:

·      Finalize the dAppNode docker package ·      Improve on-boarding process (which needs a lot of work)
·      Continue to parallelize major parts of backend, speeding it up 10-fold or more
Work on front-end and different modules
Explore modification for L2 sidechains
Explore architectures in anticipation of ETH 2.0 sharding
Write much better documentation

Please help us finalize the only true data query tool, which recognizes that data on the blockchain belongs to all of us, and as such facilitates full decentralization and democratization of Ethereum blockchain data.
