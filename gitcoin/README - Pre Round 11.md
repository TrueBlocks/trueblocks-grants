## About
----

TrueBlocks is a user-centric data query and management tool for the Ethereum blockchain. Users can access, view and manage their data across multiple accounts and dApps fully decentralized and 100% privately.

TrueBlocks is one of the few tools that allows users to access data from the node in a fully decentralized manner. Zero reliance on centralized servers or overly complicated marketplaces. While it works with Infura and other node providers (if you don’t have a node), it works significantly better and faster if you’re running your own node.

TrueBlocks gets us closer to realizing the dream of self-sovereign, permissionless, 18-decimal-place-accurate, reconciled access to your own data (or anyone else’s data for that matter) free of central parties and skewed incentives.

## Results from Previous Rounds
----

Thank you to our supporters from previous GitCoin Grant rounds. We appreciate the support you’ve provided to keep this mostly self-funded project going. 

[Here’s a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqqgPfCvCAQ) which describes some of what we’ve accomplished since the last round of grants. We are pleased to note that we won a prize from HackFS for our work on publishing Ethereum index data to IPFS. This work will go a long way towards the decentralization and democratization of the data.

Here’s an updated schematic of How TrueBlocks Works.

[Check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFbH010A-QA) which is a reminder of TrueBlocks’ "user-centric browsing"—a way of viewing Ethereum data that brings the data to you rather than you having to go to the data.

## Potential Use Cases
----

These are a few of the possible use cases...

- View complete history of an account (or accounts) from any device (via TrueBlocks’ API)
- Export fully reconciled transactions to QuickBooks, Excel, RStudio, CSV
- Build a token manager (where are my tokens? how many approvals?)
- Enable off-chain email notifications/triggers of activity on your addresses
- Duplicate the indexing provided by theGraph for free (future work)
- Watch activity of DAOs you belong to (what votes are active?)

All completely local to your own machine, perfectly private, uncensorable and immutable.

## How Future Contributions Will Help
----
We’ve accomplished a lot with your support, but there’s more work to do:

- Complete the dAppNode docker package (this is a work-in-progress; we’ve hired someone to help with this)
- Improve on-boarding process (which needs a lot of work)
- Parallelize major parts of backend, speeding it up 10-fold or more
- Explore architectures in anticipation of ETH 2.0 sharding
- Write much better documentation

Help us finalize the only true data query tool that facilitates full decentralization and democratization of Ethereum Blockchain data.
